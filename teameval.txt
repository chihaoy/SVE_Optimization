		Team Self Evaluation Form, Assignment #1

Each team must submit one copy of this self evaluation form. 
The members of each team should discuss how they
worked together and what to write for the evaluation.
If you worked alone leave column B blank

(1) List the names of your team members:

A: Yichi Yang

 
B: Chihao Yu

 
 
(2) Estimate how much time each team member devoted to this project, in HOURS.

  	                        A 	       B
meetings 	  	  	        2      2
coding 	  	  	            8          8
writeup 	  	  	        6      7
planning (alone) 	  	  	2      3
total (including meetings) 	18  	      20


(3) Discuss the following.
(a) If you worked in a team, what were the major responsibilities
    of each team member?

    Yichi
    - Implemented packing
    - Implemented various kernels
        - bl_dgemm_ukr_sve_4x4
        - bl_dgemm_ukr_sve_4x4_alternative
        - bl_dgemm_ukr_sve_8x4
        - bl_dgemm_ukr_sve_4x4_butterfly
        - bl_dgemm_ukr_sve_4x8
        - bl_dgemm_ukr_sve_4x12
    - Did some manual tuning & automatic parameter search
    - Wrote Q1, Q2c, Q2e; parts of Q2b, Q2d
     Chihao Yu
     -implement bl_dgemm_ukr_sve_2x4 kernel
     -improve packing to have unrolling(although it turns out not improving performance)
     -Using sciprt file to find the best set of paramaters
     -Wrote Q2a, parts of Q2bQ2d
     -improce every kernel mentioned through loop unrolling, restrict pointers,
     -testing the cache miss percentage

(b) Did you complete the assignment?
Yes.

(c) What were your major strengths and weaknesses in doing this
    assignment (individually or in a team)?
    If in a team, also discuss how your team worked together.

    Yichi
    - I'm familiar with computer architecture concepts, but this is my first
      time working with the ARM instruction set (I'm more familiar with
      x86_64), so it took me some time (reading documentation) to get started.
     Chihao Yu:
	Last time I studies computer architecture is a year ago, so it takes me some
time to bve familiar wih the concepts. And my strength is I am always eager to learn 
and ask my teammate questions when I do not understand.
    

How we worked as a team:
    - We mostly collaborated online. We independently come up with
      new ideas to try, try them out, and then share and analyze
      the results together. For the parameter search / profiling
      part we aligned on what data we need to collect and each of
      us ran parts of the experiment so we can collect data faster.

(d) What  lessons did you learn from these events.
Yichi - the SVE instruction set, how to profile programs and measure caching behavior
Chihao - the SVE instruction set, how to do the packing and various kernels and how to tune the parameter

(e) If in a team, whether and how you plan to change the way
    your work together .
Yichi - I think we are a good team. There's nothing I plan to change.
Chihao Yu - I think overall we did really well

(f) Anything else that comes to mind.
Yichi - I don't have additional comments.
Chihao - I don't have additional comments.

(g) What suggestions do you have to improve this assignment?
Yichi - I don't have specific suggestions but I like how many questions are open ended.
